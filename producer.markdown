👋🏽  welcome to my personal site. My name is Peter Hironaka. I’m 29 years old and I currently reside in Venice, CA. For the past 5 years, I've been a Digital and Social Media Content Producer, working with some of the coolest brands in the world. While it's been a blast and I still enjoy my role as a Producer, my ultimate goal is to become a Front End Web Developer.
