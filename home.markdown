Hello 👋🏼, my name is Peter Hironaka.

a Front-End Developer based in Venice, California. When I’m not in the ocean attempting to surf, I can be found  reading a book or refactoring old bits of Open Source code. If you have a project you’re interested in collaborating on, feel free to drop me a line on email.

Otherwise, I can be found on the usual: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat.

Here is my Resumé.

Boom.
