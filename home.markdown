Hello 👋🏼, my name is Peter Hironaka. I’m a Front-End Developer based in sunny Venice, California. When I’m not in the ocean attempting to surf, I can be found reading a book or refactoring old bits of Open Source code. If you have a project you’re interested in collaborating on, feel free to drop me a line on email. Here is what I am working on right now:

Otherwise, I can be found on the usual: [Twitter](http://twitter.com/peterhironaka), [Instagram](http://instagram.com/peterhironaka), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterhironaka), and Snapchat.

Here is a direct link to my [Portfolio](/work).

If you're interested in checking out some of my previous work experience, my CV can be found [here](/resume).

Boom.
