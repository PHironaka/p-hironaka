After much tossing and turning, I've decided to take the plunge and invest a chunk of my weekly agenda into this here currently non-existant blog. I read a ton of blogs and sites and have recently felt inspired enough to share my point of view with the world. I mean, it is 2015 right?? If nothing else, it will provide me some time to strengthen my puny writing skills (bare with me, it's going to take some time to find my stride...) Here's what I'd like the focus of my posts to be (These are all subject to change at any given time):

### Trophies

The last thing I'd want to do is turn this whole endeavor into a boast fest of all my accomplishments. Having said that, I do intend to highlight certain moments or feats of my own that deserve recognition. It could be a  product launch (foreshadowing), it could be a new job, a basket weaving competition, whatever. I'll leave this one open-ended for now.

### Community Involvement

It's a big part of my list of Goals for 2015, and to ensure that I deliver in full, I will make the effort to also update the blog on all new happenings in this arena. Really feel it's important to give back to my local community and do my part to make it a better place to live. 


### Web Development and Beyond!

This is just the beginning. What lies before you is but a mere responsive/quick/ static foundation. I want to develop my Front End skills further and teach myself a bunch of languages - mainly Ruby, Python, Django, Java, Swift, and more. No better place than to start right here.

### Life Reckoning 

In an effort to stay private, I will keep these posts to a minimum. 

There you have it. Guess it's time to [ kick the tires and light the fire ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F1bMG9wzXY) .
