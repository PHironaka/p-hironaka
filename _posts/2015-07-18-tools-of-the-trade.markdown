Technology plays an integral part of my daily routine. As such, I wanted to put together a list of tools and applications I use.

### Applications I trust

[ Slack](http://slack.com) - If you've ever had a productive meeting with your team, but have had trouble maintaining that momentum and energy, give this app a shot. It provides organization and structure to real time communication unlike anything else I've tested. A must have tool for creative collaboration.

[ Evernote](http://evernote.com) - Keyword is convenience. When a Kramer-style "mental note" won't suffice, I turn to Evernote. Notes that travel with you wherever you go.

[ Twitterific](http://furbo.org/2013/06/28/the-origin-of-tweet/) - The ORIGINAL Twitter Client and my app of choice.

[ Dropbox](http://dropbox.com) - The only storage system I trust.

[ Noisli](http://www.noisli.com/) - When podcasts & music are too distracting, I use this app for natural sound. My preference is waves crashing :)


[ Atom for Mac](https://atom.io/) - My current text editor of choice.

Photoshop - Mainly used for Deck making, Image optimizing, and mock layouts. Still haven't made the jump to Sketch app.

Terminal - I still rock the command line cuz I'm old school.
