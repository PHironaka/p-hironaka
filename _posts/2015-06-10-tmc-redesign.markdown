Since its inception in early 2010, The Madbury Club's digital presence has evolved at the same frenetic pace as its work. It started out as a blog. Then it became a music review site. Then Spreads. Then Editorial pieces. 

In its current iteration, most of the recent content is what you'd see from a Creative Agency, with more of a focus on Client-centric deliveries. I had the opportunity to work with Phillip on the redesign as we migrated from a CMS server-side platform to the Cloud Based, Static Site Generator [ Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com).

I was able to dig up a large number of archived works TMC had produced in the past and give them new life in a responsive layout. Responsibilities included Web Development, Design, Project Management, Development of Tumblr Theme. Visit [ The Madbury Club ](http://madburyclub.com) to get the full experience.
