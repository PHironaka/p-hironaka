👋🏽  welcome to my personal site. My name is Peter Hironaka. I’m 29 years old and I currently reside in Venice, CA. For the past 5 years, I've been a Digital and Social Media Content Producer, working with some of the coolest brands in the world. While it's been a blast and I still enjoy my role as a Producer, my ultimate goal is to become a Front End Web Developer.

I'm hoping to keep this v348 of my website maintained w/some semblance of regularity, but we all know that's just wishful thinking. You'll notice my home page is contains a list of projects I've been involved with, either on the Producer side or as a Front End Dev. If a more comprehensive breakout and case study of each project is required, great. But for now, those brief descriptions will have to suffice.

Enough of the boring stuff though, right? Here's a few things I'm into these days:

1. Teaching myself to 🏄🏽
2. Stranger things
3. The ocean and how we can preserve its beauty as humans
4. Figuring out how Kevin Durant is going to fit into that Splash Brothery monstrosity up in The Bay.
5. Reading
6. Keeping our beaches clean
7. Seeing the world through Kamauri's eyes
8. Flake's Turkey Sausage Breakfast Burrito
