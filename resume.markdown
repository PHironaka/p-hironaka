## Resum√© of Peter Hironaka

The last thing I'd want to do is turn this whole endeavor into a boast fest of all my accomplishments. Having said that, I do intend to highlight certain moments or feats of my own that deserve recognition. It could be a  product launch (foreshadowing), it could be a new job, a basket weaving competition, whatever. I'll leave this one open-ended for now..

### Hulu - Digital Producer, Marketing // Aug 2015 - July 2016

### The Madbury Club - Digital Producer & Front-End Web Developer // January 2013 - May 2015

It's a big part of my list of Goals for 2015, and to ensure that I deliver in full, I will make the effort to also update the blog on all new happenings in this arena. Really feel it's important to give back to my local community and do my part to make it a better place to live. 


### Wieden + Kennedy // November 2011 - January 2013

This is just the beginning. What lies before you is but a mere responsive/quick/ static foundation. I want to develop my Front End skills further and teach myself a bunch of languages - mainly Ruby, Python, Django, Java, Swift, and more. No better place than to start right here.
