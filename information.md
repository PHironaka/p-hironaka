# Established 1987.

👋🏽  welcome to my personal site. My name is Peter Hironaka. I’m 29 years old and I currently reside in Venice, CA. For the past 5 years, I've been a Digital and Social Media Content Producer, working with some of the coolest brands in the world. While it's been a blast and I still enjoy my role as a Producer, my ultimate goal is to become a Front End Web Developer.

I'm hoping to keep this v348 of my website maintained w/some semblance of regularity, but we all know that's just wishful thinking. You'll notice my home page is contains a list of projects I've been involved with, either on the Producer side or as a Front End Dev. If a more comprehensive breakout and case study of each project is required, great. But for now, those brief descriptions will have to suffice.
