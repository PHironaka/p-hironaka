# Established 1987.

For the past 5 years, I've been a Digital and Social Media Content Producer, working with some of the coolest brands in the world. While it's been a blast and I still enjoy my role as a Producer, my ultimate goal is to become a Front End Web Developer. 2017 is the year this happens.

If you're interested in collaborating on a project or just want to say hello, please email me: [peterhironaka@mac.com](mailto:peterhironaka@mac.com).
